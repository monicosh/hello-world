# hello-world
Monica here.
I am venturing into the unknown [world of coding] as my legs carry me swiftly in the direction of a desire my mind knows little of: data science.  Armed with nothing more than curiousity and a willingness to learn, I have approached ground zero: my first Hello-World at GitHub.
When I was little, I wanted to be an athropologist when I grew up. ("Said no child ever" except me.)  My naivet√© in assuming it was a (well)paying profession quickly evaporated as I stared down an expensive path through academia.  Instead, I discovered that travels involving "living with locals" was the next best thing.  Fast forward some twenty years and I have worked in sales, marketing and finance at various medium-sized consumer goods' companies and have lived in various places - literally from Alaska to Brazil.
It is not my objective to become a 'unicorn',  but rather to at least understand and even - dare I say - become comfortable with  programming to commuicate and work effectively with a team of brilliant minds.
Project ideas pile high in my brain and I hope that by becoming a part of the GitHub community, I can connect with individuals smarter than I to help extract some of the most interesting ones and bring them to life so they, too, can one day say "Hello, world."
